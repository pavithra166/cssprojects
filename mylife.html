                Mathematics.
                My life in CEG was fantastic.I lived in my dream college.I enjoyed a lot with my friends and enjoyed
                each and every second in my college.
                This college thought lot of good things through both good and bad exprience.
                Lets see deep about my exprience in my college.</p>

                    class started on August 21,2017.It was one of the memorable day where I found lot of new faces.I interacted with few people in my class.
                    Later,the days are passed by exploring things in campus.The assesment are geared up and we all started studying.Intially it was tough to study.
                    Then finally culturals are began,we enjoyed each and every programme.First year was very slow and itwas a hardship because we are all missed
                    our families.Finally vaccation had came we all happy to pack our things and vaccated the hostels.
