	<p style="font-family:'League Gothic', sans-serif;">If you’re a beginner to code and just started learning HTML and CSS, you may be wondering what HTML and CSS projects you
	can do to build your portfolio and hone your skills. You might even ask whether or not you can actually do anything with
	just HTML and CSS knowledge! The good news is that there are many types of HTML and CSS projects out there that
	beginners can use to practice coding, build up skills, keep learning, level up your knowledge, and even start earning
	money.</p>
    <p  style="font-family:'Fredoka', sans-serif;">The first website I built — the final project of a video lesson series on an online learning platform — was made purely with HTML and CSS. Even though it was a basic static web page for a fake bakery that would never be seen or hosted anywhere, I was thrilled. I had created something that wasn’t there before, using code. As an English major, using language in this tangible way was new to me, and HTML and CSS made it possible. The experience motivated me to continue learning — I’m still learning today, even after years of working as a software engineer.</p>
