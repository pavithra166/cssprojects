If you are at this Canteen in evenings don't try to miss out the Pav Baji and Gulub Jamun. Before a couple of years Onion Samosa used to be there everyday but these days it's put up Very rarely. Prices of Juices are low comparatively but are very bad in quality. Watermelon Juice is better choice if available.,</p>
