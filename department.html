                <p>The Department of Mathematics is one of the largest units of Anna University with faculty strength of
                    70 to cater the needs of the Under-Graduate and Post-Graduate programmes in Science, Engineering and
                    Technology. The Department has been started in the year 1975 with M.Sc. programme in Mathematics. In
                    1979, research programmes were started which are leading to M.Phil, and Ph.D. in Mathematics.
                    Subsequently in the year 1993, it has started M.Sc. Mathematics with Diversification in Computer
                    Science, which was renamed as M.Sc. (Computer Science) in 1997. From the academic year 2001,
                    Five-year Integrated M.Sc Programmes in Computer Science and Information Technology are being
                    offered. These two programmes are successfully offering by the Department of Mathematics and most of
                    the students are placed in IT companies across the world.</p>

                <p>The Department of Civil Engineering of Anna University is the oldest in the Country. It dates back to
                    May 17, 1794, when the East India Company established a Survey School to train military personnel
                    and surveyors. This has grown to a Civil Engineering School in 1858 and later a Civil Engineering
                    College in 1859.</p>
                <p>Over the years with the help of dedicated group of people, it expanded to the present level as one of
                    a highly reputed group of Civil Engineering Departments in the country. Presently the Department of
                    Civil Engineering has six well established disciplines - Structures, Water Resources, Soil
                    Mechanics, Environmental Engineering, Urban Engineering and Remote Sensing.</p>
